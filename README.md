# Application_Data



Create a “Node.js” Application using Express Framework and MongoDB Database and Connect it to your Frontend Application (Which can be developed using either React )


Use the provided sample data to load your Database. Please refer to sample data file “sample_data.json”. This file is attached separately. 


You must fetch the following data using the API and display it on the frontend in a table format:


1. Users which have income lower than $5 USD and have a car of brand “BMW” or “Mercedes”.
2. Male Users which have phone price greater than 10,000.
3. Users whose last name starts with “M” and has a quote character length greater than 15 and email includes his/her last name.
4. Users which have a car of brand “BMW”, “Mercedes” or “Audi” and whose email does not include any digit.
5. Show the data of top 10 cities which have the highest number of users and their average income.

API should be EFFICIENT AND FAST as much as possible.

You can use any npm package to achieve the above task.


We would like to evaluate your skills on “node.js” and “react”.
